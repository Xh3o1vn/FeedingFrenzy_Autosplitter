# FeedingFrenzy_Autosplitter

AutoSplitter for Feeding Frenzy.

## Game Preparation

It's recommended to run Ver.5.7.18.1 or Ver.2.9.16.1 of Feeding Frenzy (You can click **Game Options** on **Main Menu** to see the version). Ver. 2.9.16.1 is provided at [Resources](https://www.speedrun.com/feeding_frenzy/resources). Other versions may not be compatible with the Autosplitter.

## Autosplitter Settings

Make sure you have already downloaded Livesplit.

Open Livesplit. There are two ways to set Autosplitter.

* Right-click **Edit Splits**, and type *Feeding Frenzy* in **Game Name** (Must be the complete and correct game name),  after Autosplitter is identified, click Activate.

* Download the .asl file. Right-click **Layout Editor**, clike **+** on the left and select **Control** - **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, then double click **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, click **Browse** and select the .asl file you have downloaded.

P.S. Only one of the two methods can be chosen, otherwise the segmentation may occur twice.

## Start Time Setting

Whether you do an Any% speedrun or a single Stage speedrun, set **Start Timer at:** to -2.20.

## Any%

If you do an Any% Speedrun, please make sure your Livesplit have 40 splits. You can download Feeding Frenzy Any% Splits [here](https://www.speedrun.com/feeding_frenzy/resources), Autosplitter will automatically segment once at the beginning of each level when it is loaded.

## Individual Stage

If you do an individual stage Speedrun in normal mode, please check **Single Stage Split** in **Settings** of Autosplitter and keep Livesplit with only one segment (or right-click on the Livesplit page and select **Close Splits**, but this will require you to re-fill the information in **Edit Splits**). Since it's unable to select specific stage in Time Attack! mode, this mode is not under consideration. However, you can submit the individual stage Speedrun from an Any% Speedrun to the Level Leaderboard.

P.S. If you plan to run a single bonus stage, make sure you eat **at least 1 fish** (poisonous fish, pearls, starfish bubbles are all acceptable) before the end of the level, otherwise the timer will not stop due to no change in foodbank, and a better end judgment method will be found in the future to replace the existing method.

## Reset Function 

Reset function is activated by default, which means timer will reset once you return to the main menu. If you do not need the function, you can uncheck **Reset** in **Settings** of Autosplitter in **Splits Editor**.

## Other Information

Autosplitter is not necessary, if you don't need Autosplitter you can deactive it. You can still manually time your run with or without Livesplit (Moderator will retime your run manually), but we still recommend you to use it to finish your speedrun to make it easier for moderators to check your time.
