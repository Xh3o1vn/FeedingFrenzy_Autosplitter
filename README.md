# Feeding Frenzy Autosplitter on PC

AutoSplitter for Feeding Frenzy.

## Game Preparation

It is recommended to run v5.7.18.1 or v2.9.16.1 of Feeding Frenzy (you can click **Game Options** on **Main Menu** to see the version). v2.9.16.1 is provided at [Resources](https://www.speedrun.com/feeding_frenzy/resources). Other versions may not be compatible with the Autosplitter.

## Autosplitter Settings

Make sure you have already downloaded Livesplit.

Open Livesplit. There are two ways to set the Autosplitter.

* Right-click **Edit Splits**, and type *Feeding Frenzy* in **Game Name** (must be complete and correct),  after Autosplitter is identified, click Activate.
* Download the .asl file. Right-click **Layout Editor**, click **+** on the left and select **Control** -> **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, then double click **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, click **Browse** and select the .asl file you have downloaded.

P.S. Only choose either of the two methods, otherwise the segmentation may occur twice.

## Any%

If you're trying to do an Any% Speedrun, please make sure your Livesplit have 40 splits. You can download Feeding Frenzy Any% Splits [here](https://www.speedrun.com/feeding_frenzy/resources); Autosplitter will automatically segment at the beginning of each level when it is loaded.

## Individual Stage

If you're trying to do an Individual Stage Speedrun in normal mode, please check **Individual Stage Split** in **Settings** of Autosplitter and keep Livesplit with only one segment (or right-click on the Livesplit page and select **Close Splits**, but this will require you to refill the information in **Edit Splits**). You can submit the Individual Stage Speedrun from an Any% Speedrun to the Level Leaderboard.

P.S. If you plan to run a bonus stage, make sure you eat **at least 1 fish** (poisonous fish, pearls, starfish bubbles are all acceptable) before the end of the stage, otherwise the timer will not stop due to no change in foodbank, and a better end checking method will be found in the future to replace the existing one.

## Reset Function 

Reset function is activated by default, which means timer will reset once you return to the main menu. If you don't need the function, you can uncheck **Reset** in **Settings** of Autosplitter in **Splits Editor**.

## Other Information

Autosplitter is not necessary, it can be deactivated if you don't need it. You can still manually time your run with or without Livesplit (moderators will retime your run manually), but we still recommend you to use it to finish your speedrun to make it easier for moderators to check your time.
